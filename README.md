# Challenge description

Implement a bare-bones blog with an admin page for creating new posts in rails. The requirements are:
1. User authentication is not required; it's enough to have a separate `/admin` path for creating/updating/deleting posts
2. Should use a Postgresql database
3. Should have tests
4. An administrator should be able to create new blog posts
    - Contains a title and body
5. The root index page should show all the posts with:  
    - The post title
    - The first 50 characters of the post body
6. When clicking on a post title, you see:
    - The post title
    - The full post body
    - A list of comments
    - A way to create a new comment
    - A comment contains the body and email
